# Controlled Vocabularies
Where categorical data is required across our data standards, we require a clear definitions of what categories can be chosen for what kinds of data, what each category means, how it is encoded, and more. This repo serves as a central location for this information.


### Where do we need controlled vocabularies?

#### Placement spec
* planned vs emergency, although that's meant to be a boolean so idk maybe the spec needs changing there
* daily / few times a week / whatever -- just need codes for these
* communication needs
